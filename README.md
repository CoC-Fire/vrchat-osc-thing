a random thing i made.

the quest version doesnt work :sob: (currently trying to find ways to make windows not hate me)

i think with the new version its signed or something idk

to download and install, go to https://github.com/CoC-Fire/vrchat-osc-thing/blob/main/osc_installer.bat and click the "download raw" button, then double click the downloaded file

THE AUTO UPDATER IS BROKEN. IM TOO TIRED TO FIX IT RIGHT NOW. I JUST WANNA PLAY VRCHAT. CHECK BACK LATER FOR UPDATES.

i'll add something to disable the currently playing media checker later

if u want to refresh the program just press enter on the console window it opens

DO NOT CLOSE THE CONSOLE WINDOW OR IT WILL CLOSE THE PROGRAM

make sure u enabled osc in vrchat first for it to work https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101527472/189733533-957f6e92-ebba-4c67-b857-f1abac9d0eb3.gif

if osc is enabled and its not working, try refreshing the program (press enter) or checking ur firewall settings

when trying to run it, if windows says it protected ur pc, simply click more info then click run anyway.

if you get a notification about "threats detected", you may need to create an exception in windows defender, since pyinstaller compiles similar to malware

to install manually, first download extract osc.zip, then open the folder, then run the "osc.exe" contained within the folder

gpu doesnt work for amd gpus for some reason
