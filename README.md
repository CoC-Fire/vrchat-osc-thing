a random thing i made.

this only works on desktop or pc vr.

download: https://github.com/CoC-Fire/vrchat-osc-thing/raw/main/osc.exe

i'll add something to disable the currently playing media checker later

if u want to refresh the program just press enter on the console window it opens

DO NOT CLOSE THE CONSOLE WINDOW OR IT WILL CLOSE THE PROGRAM

make sure u enabled osc in vrchat first for it to work https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101527472/189733533-957f6e92-ebba-4c67-b857-f1abac9d0eb3.gif

if osc is enabled and its not working, try refreshing the program (press enter) or checking ur firewall settings

when trying to run the .exe, if windows says it protected ur pc, simply click more info then click run anyway
